uLisp x86_64 emulator is console application created by QtCreator.

IThis program is an emulator of the lisp interpreter for
microcontrollers uLisp developed by David Johnson-Davies (http://www.ulisp.com/)

The interpreter connects to the qDisplayServer graphics server if
the server was previously running.

Two archives are separate projects that are built by QtCreator.

1. Unpack uLisp.zip and qDisplayServer archives separately.
2. Build them using QtCreator.
3. Run qDisplayServer.
4. Copy the "*.l" files (examples in Lisp) to the directory where the uLisp executable is located.
5. Run uLisp.
6. Look at DisplayServer, try pressing the arrows or 'h' for a hint.
